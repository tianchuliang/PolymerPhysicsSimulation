# PolymerPhysicsSimulation
This repo contains a C++ program that simulates the random motion of self-binding polymer with variable lengths. The program implements a Monte-Carlo Simulation, in particular, utilizing Metropolis Hasting Algorithm. The Repo also contains necessary Mathematica files to generate frames of particle's movements over a specified amount of time steps.
